noncomputable theory

We need to assume a physical interpretation of the data
representing our coordinate system on time. We derive a new ACS from 
"coordinated_universal_time_in_seconds" - see time_std.lean 
for a more details on the coordinate system and physical interpretation
(note : this is a conventional UTC ACS expressed with units in seconds)

The gist of this interpretation is that we need an ACS whose units are seconds -
for this example, we define a space centered at "now" -

We define a second time ACS which is intended to represent UTC, at the same
time origin as our prior ACS, but whose units represent nanoseconds.

We define a base link ACS, which is intended to represent the ACS
centered at the robot, in terms of the world frame, and oriented at the robot,
in terms of the world frame.

We define the robot to be 3 meters to the right of the left wall, 4 meters
in north of the bottom wall, and 1 meter above the ground. It's rotated 1 radian
around it's yaw axis relative to the world's orientation.

We provide a static interpretation for constructors builtin_interfaces::msg::Time and 
tf2::Duration. We define the constructor of the former as a function from a scalar to a 
time expressed in the utc.coords ACS. The latter, we define as a function from a scalar
to a duration in utc_ns.coords

def tf2Duration : scalar → duration utc_ns.coords := λs, (inhabited.default _)

We define a method "test" for the test case. In the body, firstly, a scalar is defined. Next, 
a vector of times are defined, several times are then constructed and inserted into the list. 

Next, a vector of durations is defined. Several durations are constructed and then added to the list. 
We notice that several errors occur as the items are added to the list. The tf2Duration constructor returns
a "duration utc_ns.coords", but the type of the durations vector is a "list (duration utc.coords)"

We define fixed interpretations for the constructor of tf2 Time Point
and the member function "canTransform" of the tf2 Buffer

Firstly, we interpret tf2TimePoint as a function that accepts a scalar
and returns a time expressed in "utc.coords"

Nextly, we interpret canTransform to be a function that accepts both a time expressed in 
"utc.coords" and a duration expressed in "utc.coords".

def tf2TimePoint : scalar → time utc.coords := λs, inhabited.default _
def canTransform : time utc.coords → duration utc.coords → punit := 
  λt d, punit.star

/-
We provide an interpretation for the main method of the tf2 "echo" implementation.
When "canTransform" is called, we supply a constructed value of type tf2Duration,
whichs returns a value of type "duration utc_ns.coords", however,
the call to canTransform expects a parameter of type "duration utc.coords",
thus, an error occurs.
