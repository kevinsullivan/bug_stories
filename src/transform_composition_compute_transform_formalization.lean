We need to assume a physical interpretation of the data
representing our coordinate system on time. We derive a new ACS from 
"coordinated_universal_time_in_seconds" - see time_std.lean 
for a more details on the coordinate system and physical interpretation
(note : this is a conventional UTC ACS expressed with units in seconds)


This example does not require any specialized timespaces beyond a simple
world time space.

Transpilation of "tf::Transform::setIdentity"
Notice that this method is "bound" to pose3d in Lean, so there is an interesting subtlety in how these would need to be 
printed off (possibly with duplicates).

The other aspect to notice is that the purpose of this method, in C++, is an in-place assignment. We lose a particular aspect of the 
original semantics here. We can see a re-assignment of the argument, p, below. However, the original semantics require an in-place assignment.
Thus, the caller expects that the member argument, p, has been re-assigned, but, as it is modeled, 
the member argument is assigned *into* p0, and the enclosing scope does not have access to the updated value of p. 
This is a broader issue and does not have a simple solution, such as forcibly convering this method and all call sites as assignments.

Just as above, transpilation of "getRPY" call from matrices or quaternions in ROS. 
The intended semantics of this method should perform an in-place assignment of the arguments, 
(roll pitch and yaw angles). Unfortunately, we face the same challenge as above. 

(also, I haven't implemented the Lean orientation call to retrieve these values...will do so soon)

This is the formalization of a helper function reference in the function "computeTransform",
formalized below, which describes the error of interest to the issue. There are no physical
type errors in this method, although formalizing raised some interesting issues. 

It is defined as a "Lean-esque member function" of NavSatTransform.

For example, Poses and Transforms share the same type in C++, whereas they are modeled differently

    /-
    cartesian_orientation.setRPY(roll, pitch, yaw);
    A note here: A more "literal" translation of the above line would involve a call to "setRPY",
    which, again, is an in-place assignment to cartesian_orientation. Fortunately, if we don't
    attempt that route, we can directly assign to the variable (SSA-style) using "mk_orientation3d_from_euler_angles",
    which carries the same semantics as the original C++.

    We have no way of formalizing this code. "offset" is intended to be a transform - but we provide 
    no way to set the "origin" or "rotation" of a Transform, and, it's not a simple fix, it's a bit beyond the scope of 
    our formalization currently.

void NavSatTransform::computeTransform()

This is the principal function in which the error of interest is modeled. 
It is a member function of the C++ class "NavSatTransform", and here, in Lean, it is modeled
as a "member function" of the structure NavSatTransform. 

The gist of the function and error, below, is that we will first "construct" 
  the Transform from UTM → Base Link Yaw Only, T₁, and then we will "use" the member transform_world_pose_, T₂,
  of NavSatTransform, which is a transform from World → Base Link, in order to construct a transform from 
  World → UTM, by taking T₂∘(T₁⁻¹). However, the domain of T₁⁻¹ does not match the codomain of T₂,
  yielding a type error in Lean that was not captured in the original code.

      We have no way to formalize these two lines. As described earlier, in our current architecture, a 
      Transform is defined simply by providing two coordinate spaces, and we receive the *fixed* transform
      between those two spaces. In ROS, coordinate spaces *vary* over time, and thus, transforms are not necessarily 
      fixed, and we can assign to their properties in an ad hoc manner, which often represents a transform at a particular time.
      Time Series, at least as we've currently modeled them, do not provide a solution to this limitation.

      To capture the semantics, I ignore the constructed transform_cartesian_pose_corrected origin and imu_quat, and
      construct the transform from UTM → Base Link Yaw Only as we conventionally construct it.
